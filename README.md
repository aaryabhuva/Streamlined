# Streamlined

Setup:

Install Python on your device, and create a virtual environment for this folder if you wish to do so (if you don't know what a virtual environment is, ignore and carry on).

Then execute the following command on your terminal:

pip3 install kivy

This is required for the graphical interface to function correctly.

To run the text interface, type "python3 text_interface.py" on your terminal, once you locate this particular folder on your device.

To run the graphical interface, similarly type "python3 graphical_interface.py" on your terminal.

Install Arduino IDE to work with the circuit, and identify the port that the Arduino is connected to. Change the values in database.py as required. Install simulide to run the simulation. Good luck, hopefully it works on your device too! :P
